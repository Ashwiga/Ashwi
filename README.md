#This project is divided into 4 major tasks:

🔹 Task 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaned time-series data

Identified missing & abnormal values

Visualized Index Value trends

Distribution of Prominent Pollutant

Monthly & yearly AQI patterns

🔹 Task 2 — Time-Series Forecasting (Supervised Learning)

Converted dataset into sliding window format

Built ML models to predict next-day AQI

Models used:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

LSTM (optional in your project)

Evaluated with MAE, RMSE

Plotted Actual vs Predicted AQI

🔹 Task 3 — Clustering Pollution Patterns (Unsupervised Learning)

Applied K-Means Clustering

Grouped days into:

Low Pollution

Moderate Pollution

High Pollution

Visualized clusters & centroids

Interpreted AQI category ranges

🔹 Task 4 — AI Seasonal Pollution Pattern Detector

Calculated monthly average AQI

Categorized each month into:

Clean

Moderate

High Pollution

Automatically generated seasonal insights

Identified months with consistent severe pollution
