# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis  
#### Project using Python

## 📌 Overview
This project performs a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Air Quality Index (AQI) data.  
It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, trend analysis, correlation study, and insights generation.

The goal is to understand pollution behaviour over time and identify key pollutants influencing AQI levels.

**This project is divided into 4 major tasks:**

🔹 **Task 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Cleaned time-series data

Identified missing & abnormal values

Visualized Index Value trends

Distribution of Prominent Pollutant

Monthly & yearly AQI patterns

**🔹 Task 2 — Time-Series Forecasting (Supervised Learning)**

Converted dataset into sliding window format

Built ML models to predict next-day AQI

Models used:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

LSTM (optional in your project)

Evaluated with MAE, RMSE

Plotted Actual vs Predicted AQI

**🔹 Task 3 — Clustering Pollution Patterns (Unsupervised Learning)**

Applied K-Means Clustering

Grouped days into:

Low Pollution

Moderate Pollution

High Pollution

Visualized clusters & centroids

Interpreted AQI category ranges

**🔹 Task 4 — AI Seasonal Pollution Pattern Detector**

Calculated monthly average AQI

Categorized each month into:

Clean

Moderate

High Pollution

Automatically generated seasonal insights

Identified months with consistent severe pollution
